# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

## Project Description
### Goal
- A simple single-page AJAX-based Twitter clone that uses jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and MongoDB

- The server is built with Node, Express and Mongo and allows users to request and submit tweets via a JSON end-point. 

### Potential Improvements
- User can like a post again after page refresh. This is due to the fact that the app does not keep track of who has liked the post, nor have implemented the account managemnet. 
- However the basic functionality works and the likes are being recorded on MongoDB.
- Responsive Web Design
